VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    In your "dist.ini":

       [Twitter]

    In your ".netrc":

        machine api.twitter.com
          login YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME
          password YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will use Net::Twitter with the login and password in your
    ".netrc" file to send a release notice to Twitter.

    The default configuration is as follows:

       [Twitter]
       tweet_url = http://frepan.64p.org/~{{$AUTHOR}}/{{$TARBALL}}
       tweet = Released {{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}} {{$URL}}

    The "tweet_url" is shortened with WWW::Shorten::TinyURL and appended to
    the "tweet" messsage. The following variables are available for
    substitution in the URL and message templates:

           DIST        # Foo-Bar
           VERSION     # 1.23
           TARBALL     # Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
           AUTHOR      # CPAN author ID (in lower case)
           URL         # TinyURL

    You must be using the "UploadToCPAN" plugin for this plugin to determine
    your CPAN author ID.
