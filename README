NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter - Twitter when you release with Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.015

SYNOPSIS
    In your "dist.ini":

       [Twitter]
       hash_tags = #foo
       url_shortener = TinyURL

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will use Net::Twitter to send a release notice to Twitter.
    By default, it will include a link to release on <http://metacpan.org>.

    The default configuration is as follows:

       [Twitter]
       tweet_url = https://metacpan.org/release/{{$AUTHOR_UC}}/{{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}/
       tweet = Released {{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}{{$TRIAL}} {{$URL}}
       url_shortener = TinyURL

    The "tweet_url" is shortened with WWW::Shorten::TinyURL or whichever
    other service you choose and appended to the "tweet" message. The
    following variables are available for substitution in the URL and
    message templates:

           DIST        # Foo-Bar
           MODULE      # Foo::Bar
           ABSTRACT    # Foo-Bar is a module that FooBars
           VERSION     # 1.23
           TRIAL       # -TRIAL if is_trial, empty string otherwise.
           TARBALL     # Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
           AUTHOR_UC   # JOHNDOE
           AUTHOR_LC   # johndoe
           AUTHOR_PATH # J/JO/JOHNDOE
           URL         # http://tinyurl.com/...

    You must be using the "UploadToCPAN" or "FakeRelease" plugin for this
    plugin to determine your CPAN author ID.

    You can use the "hash_tags" option to append hash tags (or anything,
    really) to the end of the message generated from "tweet".

       [Twitter]
       hash_tags = #perl #cpan #foo
