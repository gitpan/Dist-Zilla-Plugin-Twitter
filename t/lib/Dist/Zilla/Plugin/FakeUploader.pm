=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a C<Releaser> that does nothing. It is directed to plugin
authors, who may need a dumb release plugin to test their shiny plugin
implementing C<BeforeRelease> and C<AfterRelease>.

When this plugin does the release, it will just log a message and finish.

If you set the environment variable C<DZIL_FAKERELEASE_FAIL> to a true value,
the plugin will die instead of doing nothing. This can be usefulfor
authors wanting to test reliably that release failed.
