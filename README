NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter - Twitter when you release with Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
    In your "dist.ini":

       [Twitter]
       hash_tags = #foo

    In your ".netrc":

        machine api.twitter.com
          login YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME
          password YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin will use Net::Twitter with the login and password in your
    ".netrc" file to send a release notice to Twitter. By default, it will
    include a link to your README file as extracted on a fast CPAN mirror.
    This works very nicely with Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeFromPod.

    The default configuration is as follows:

       [Twitter]
       tweet_url = http://cpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/{{$AUTHOR_PATH}}/{{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}}.readme
       tweet = Released {{$DIST}}-{{$VERSION}} {{$URL}}

    The "tweet_url" is shortened with WWW::Shorten::TinyURL and appended to
    the "tweet" messsage. The following variables are available for
    substitution in the URL and message templates:

           DIST        # Foo-Bar
           VERSION     # 1.23
           TARBALL     # Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
           AUTHOR_UC   # JOHNDOE
           AUTHOR_LC   # johndoe
           AUTHOR_PATH # J/JO/JOHNDOE
           URL         # TinyURL

    You must be using the "UploadToCPAN" or "FakeRelease" plugin for this
    plugin to determine your CPAN author ID.

    You can use the "hash_tags" option to append hash tags (or anything,
    really) to the end of the message generated from "tweet".

       [Twitter]
       hash-tags = #perl #cpan #foo
